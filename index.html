        <section id="about">
          <p>Hi there. We are an all-volunteer fire department, serving the communities of Saint Remy, Ulster Park, and New Salem, in the Town of Esopus, since 1930. We prepare for emergencies, respond when the need arises, host local events, and generally try to have fun together.</p>

          <p>You should visit. Come to one of our social events. Or stop by <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ypGQH8si8Tv">either</a> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/mKPT3Ta6hQt">station</a> at 7:00pm on the third Monday of any month — that’s when we do preventative maintenance. See what it’s all about. Meet some nice people. No pressure. If you’re ever interested to join, or if you have any questions, talk with us in person or email <a href="mailto:stremyfd@gmail.com">stremyfd@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <section id="why">
          <h2>Why volunteer?</h2>

          <p>If you’re thinking of volunteering your time and energy, then first of all: thank you. We appreciate you considering it, even if you decide it’s not for you.</p>

          <p>Volunteering at the fire department and/or auxiliary is a commitment, but it’s not a job. We are all volunteers. There are a handful of small requirements for maintaining membership, but beyond that we each participate however we can.</p>

          <p>Some of us don airpacks and enter burning buildings. Some of us direct traffic. Some of us keep our equipment organized and in good condition. Some of us run meetings. Some of us plan events. There are a million ways to get involved. No experience is necessary, and we are always looking for new members.</p>

          <p>Our members are a diverse group of people. We don’t tolerate discrimination based on gender, age, race, disability, level of fitness, or anything else. We are simply glad to have help.</p>

          <p>However you participate, volunteering means you’re giving back to your community, helping other people, and learning new things.</p>
