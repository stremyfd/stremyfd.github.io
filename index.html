          <h2>Why volunteer?</h2>

          <p>If you’re thinking of volunteering your time and energy, then first of all: <em>Thank you!</em> We appreciate you considering it, even if you decide it’s not for you.</p>

          <p>Volunteering at the fire department and/or auxiliary is a commitment, but it’s not a job. We are all volunteers. There are a handful of small requirements for maintaining membership, but beyond that we each participate however we can.</p>

          <p>Some of us don airpacks and enter burning buildings. Some of us direct traffic. Some of us keep our equipment organized and in good condition. Some of us run meetings. Some of us plan events. There are a million ways to get involved. No experience is necessary, and we are always looking for new members.</p>

          <p>Our members are a diverse group of people. We don’t tolerate discrimination based on gender, age, race, disability, level of fitness, or anything else. We are simply glad to have help.</p>

          <p>However you participate, volunteering means you’re giving back to your community, helping other people, and learning new things.</p>

          <h2>From our members</h2>

          <blockquote>
            <p>“I joined the Fire Department shortly after moving to the community almost 15 years ago. It’s a great group of people to be involved with, willing to give their time to help their neighbors in the event of emergencies. We have members that give 2 hours a week and some that give 20, old and young, from varying backgrounds and walks of life — all working together and having fun at the same time.” —&nbsp;Kemp&nbsp;Anderson</p>
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            <p>“I love being part of the community where I live. As a remote worker with introverted-bordering-on-hermitic tendencies, I didn’t do much in my neighborhood besides drive through it. Now it feels like I belong here.” —&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@timbrown/i-never-wanted-to-be-a-firefighter-565d1f6254f9#.7uz6gkfda">Tim&nbsp;Brown</a></p>
